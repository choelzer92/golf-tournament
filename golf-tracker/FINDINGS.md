# UI findings

Running log from the critique loop in `UI_CRITIQUE_PROCESS.md`. Each entry is an
observation with options — **nothing here is fixed until Craig picks an option.**

Severity: `P1` wrong data/money · `P2` visibly confusing or slow · `P3` cosmetic.
Phase: `[start]` `[track]` `[continue]` — the north star's three verbs.

Status flow: `open` → `chosen: X` → `fixed (commit)` → `verified (e2e)`

> Findings from the pre-harness code audit live in `UI_MODE_AUDIT.md`. That file
> is the *method* + the original sweep; this file is the ongoing log from looking

## Open

### F-001 — Nassau segment "thru" reads as a hole number  [P3] [track]

**Screen:** `/pool/[id]/leaderboard`, 2-player skins w/ Nassau ·
`e2e/screenshots/skins-2p.png`
**Violates:** `UI_CONVENTIONS.md` §2 (say what the game actually is — consistent
vocabulary)

**Observed:** On a *completed* 18-hole round the Nassau board shows:

```
Front 9   $10 pot · thru 9      All tied · splits
Back 9    $10 pot · thru 9      ← the back nine is finished, not stopped at 9
Total     $20 pot · thru 18
```

`settleNassau` sets `thru` to *holes played within the segment*
(`game-modes/types.ts:257`), which is correct as data. But "thru" everywhere else
in the app means a **hole number** — including the header on this very screen
("thru hole 18").

**Why it matters:** a golfer reads "Back 9 · thru 9" as the back nine having
stalled at hole 9. It's money display, so ambiguity reads as a bug.

**Options**
- **A. Convert to a hole number per segment.** Back nine 9-of-9 → "thru 18".
  Matches the header's vocabulary exactly. Cost: `NassauLegLine.thru` becomes a
  hole number, so the not-started check (`thru === 0`) needs care.
- **B. Relabel as a count.** "9 of 9 holes". Unambiguous, no data change.
  Slightly wordier on a phone.
- **C. Leave it.** Data is right and the pot amounts are unambiguous.

**Recommendation:** B — smallest change, removes the collision, and doesn't risk
the not-started logic that keeps the board zero-sum.

**Status:** open

## Fixed & verified

Findings confirmed fixed with an e2e assertion guarding them. (The 11 fixes from
the original audit are covered by `e2e/verify-fixes.spec.ts` — side names on both
screens, 9-hole leg collapse, field-size tie detection, single-group vocabulary,
money formatting, and close-out → completed.)
